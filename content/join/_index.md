### Join as a Researcher
From July 2025, we will be at Yale University. Job calls for PostBacc and PostDoc opportunities will follow soon, but feel free to reach out to Randolph to discuss opportunities. 
We will also recruit new PhD students through the Psychology program (https://psychology.yale.edu/graduate/admissions) or the Neuroscience program (https://medicine.yale.edu/inp/).

### Opportunities:
- **Postdocs**: We will advertise positions in 2025, but there are a number of fellowship opportunities through the WuTsai Institute, (https://wti.yale.edu/initiatives/postdoctoral), various US-based agencies (https://research.jhu.edu/rdt/funding-opportunities/postdoctoral/) or for German/European applicants through e.g., the Marie Curie program, DFG, DAAD, Leopoldina or Humboldt fellowships . I’m always happy to discuss options with clinicians who are interested in research and postdoctoral training to become clinician-scientists. 
- **RA/Postbacc/lab manger positions**: We will advertise these in 2025, but it is a good idea to send an inquiry to Randolph to discuss options
- **Dr. med. / M.Sc.**: If you’re interested in performing research for your thesis at Yale, please reach out to Randolph.
