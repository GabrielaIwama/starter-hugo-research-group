### Join as a Researcher
From July 2025, we will be at Yale University. Job calls for PostBacc and PostDoc opportunities will follow soon, but feel free to reach out to Randolph to discuss opportunities. 

We are always happy to discuss individual options to join the lab at all levels. Open positions will be advertised on the official website of the [Hertie Institute](www.hih-tuebingen.de/en/helfrichlab), but if you are interested in joining, please do not hesitate to contact Randolph. Research opportunities for B.Sc./M.Sc./M.D. students can always be tailored according to individual interests. Most likely, we will be able to recruit PhD students in 2023/2024 and offer fully-funded positions, but if you are interested in applying for a fellowship (e.g. [Landesgraduiertenförderung](https://uni-tuebingen.de/forschung/service/forschungsfoerderung/foerderprogramme-baden-wuerttemberg/landesgraduiertenfoerderung/) oder [Studienstiftung](https://www.studienstiftung.de/)), we’d be happy to discuss options. At the postdoc level, we are happy to support individual fellowship applications for prospective candidates (e.g. through the [Humboldt Foundation](https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/), [DFG](https://www.dfg.de/) or [DAAD](https://www.daad.de/)). For clinician-scientists with an interest in neurology/neuroscience, please contact Randolph to discuss options, Tuebingen offers a range of intramural funding opportunities.


### Opportunities:
- **Postdocs**: We will advertise positions in 2025, but there are a number of fellowship opportunities through the WuTsai Institute, (https://wti.yale.edu/initiatives/postdoctoral), various US-based agencies (https://research.jhu.edu/rdt/funding-opportunities/postdoctoral/) or for German/European applicants through e.g., the Marie Curie program, DFG, DAAD, Leopoldina or Humboldt fellowships . I’m always happy to discuss options with clinicians who are interested in research and postdoctoral training to become clinician-scientists. 
- **RA/Postbacc/lab manger positions**: We will advertise these in 2025, but it is a good idea to send an inquiry to Randolph to discuss options
- **Dr. med. / M.Sc.**: If you’re interested in performing research for your thesis at Yale, please reach out to Randolph.
