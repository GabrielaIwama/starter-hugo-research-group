### Join as a Researcher
We are always open to hosting people with good ideas who wish to join the lab through an individual fellowship at the PhD or post-doc level (e.g., a Marie-Curie fellowship, Studienstiftung, DFG, etc). If you are interested to potentially apply for a fellowship with us as your host, please do get in touch.

Likewise, we are always open to hosting lab rotations and thesis projects for motivated master students. If you have a particular reason why you would like to do your research project with us, and wish to explore potential project directions, please do get in touch.

### Open Positions
Open positions for specific projects will be posted here.
