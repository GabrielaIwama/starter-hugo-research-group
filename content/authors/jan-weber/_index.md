### My research

I am a PhD candidate working at the intersection of cognitive and systems neuroscience. My work aims to identify how internal brain dynamics shape human cognition on different timescales. I seek to bridge the gap between hypothetical cognitive constructs (e.g. attention, decision-making, working memory) and try to follow a brain-based approach combined with detailed behavioral   modelling   to   identify their shared and unique neural mechanisms. In the future, I strive for a holistic approach to better understand how different internal brain states (e.g. wakefulness & sleep) are   mutually   dependent and modulate each other. I make use of intracranial EEG and M/EEG recordings combined with behavioral experiments to answer these questions.
