My name is Sianna, and I am currently an intern in the lab. I am interested in the memory function of sleep, particularly how sleep supports memory consolidation at the synaptic level. I am also curious about the distinct roles of cortical and hippocampal ripples in this process. Additionally, I am interested in exploring how the aperiodic component of the EEG power spectrum may capture memory processes during sleep that are not reflected by oscillatory activity.
