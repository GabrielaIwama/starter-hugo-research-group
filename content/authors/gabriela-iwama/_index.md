Hi, I am Gabriela!<br>
I am a PhD student of Neural Information Processing at the University of Tübingen. I want to understand why people have irrational beliefs. To answer that, I combine the computational and algorithmic levels in decision-making, belief updating, and information seeking. The goal of my PhD is to investigate the neural mechanism of confirmation bias in visual decisions under uncertainty. In the future, I hope to understand individual differences in psychopathologies and irrational beliefs in order to help them to make better decisions.<br>
In my free time, I like to paint mushrooms, :mushroom: and brains. :brain:
