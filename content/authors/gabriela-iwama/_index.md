Hi, I am Gabriela!
I am a master student of Neural & Behavioral Sciences at the University of Tübingen. I want to understand why people have irrational beliefs. To answer that, I combine the computational, algorithmic and neural mechanisms in decision-making, belief updating, and information seeking. The goal of my master thesis is to investigate the neural mechanism of confirmation bias in visual decisions under uncertainty. In the future, I hope to understand individual differences in psychopathologies and irrational beliefs in order to help them to make better decisions.

In my free time, I like to paint mushrooms, :mushroom: and brains. :brain:
