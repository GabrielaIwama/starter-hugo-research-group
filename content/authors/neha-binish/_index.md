Hey, I’m a PhD student interested in understanding the principles of cortical communication that support higher cognitive functioning in humans. Efficient cognitive processing involves selective and structured routing of neural information between different nodes of large-scale cortical networks. For my project, I study several proposed network
communication modes, which were previously studied in isolation, with the hypothesis that they are in fact functionally related. Outside of the lab, you can find me on the ever ongoing search for good food and roads less travelled by.
