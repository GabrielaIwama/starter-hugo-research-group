Hi, I am a PhD student and the key goal of my project is to better understand the behavioral and electrophysiological aspects of attention over time. We now know attention is not stationary but rather it oscillates over time. However, it is still unclear how a lesion in the attention network affects this process and how temporal and spatial features of attention interact. To answer these questions, I use a wide variety of methods such as M/EEG recordings, intracranial EEG, machine learning and behavioral experiments. When I am not working hard on my PhD, you can find me playing videogames :video_game: or hanging out with my friends :beer:
