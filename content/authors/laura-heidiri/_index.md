Hi, I am a master’s student interested in neural fingerprints of aberrant brain functioning. In my thesis, I utilize intracortical EEG (iEEG) recordings of pharmacoresistant patients with epilepsy to study seizure progression. Specifically, I employ the aperiodic component of the power spectrum as a biomarker to classify ictal states. With my project, I emphasize how spectral analyses facilitate a better understanding of pathomechanisms of abnormal brain activity that can lead to targeted development of therapeutic interventions.
Whenever I am not plotting power spectra, I like to explore Tübingen, surroundings, and the rest of the world with a backpack and some friends.
