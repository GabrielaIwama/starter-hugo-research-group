Hi, I am a Master’s student of Neural and Behavioral Sciences at the University of Tübingen. Currently, I am studying the concept of cognitive reserve in a human glioma model as part of my Master’s thesis at the University of San Francisco, California. I am especially interested in why some patients with the same degree of pathology show different symptom manifestations.
In my free time I love to go outside and do any kinds of sports like running, hiking or playing Ultimate Frisbee
